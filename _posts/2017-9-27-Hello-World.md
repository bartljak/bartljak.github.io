title: First Blog Post
---

In my first week of research I worked on multiple issues on the Scratch 3.0 github profile. I also created this blog! Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to fix any bugs. However, I did go through and recreate multiple bugs that had been posted with different browsers and operating systems, and started debugging. The main issue I focused on was a bug causing the timer to periodically display .001 seconds instead of 0 seconds when a resettimer block was in a forever loop.
