This week I worked on two main issues for the scratch-gui vm. The first issue was issue #1753 which
was causing sprite-selector-item's close button to overlap the sprite-selector action-menu. I fixed this issue 
by changing the z-index of the different elements around so no more overlapping occurred.

The next issue I worked on was issue #1702 which was asking for 'random direction' option to be added to the dropdown 
menu for the 'point towards' block. I implemented a fix for this issue, but because the fix required editing of code accross 
the gui repo and the VM repo, one of the head contributers told me to wait until next week as they will be 
consolodating the code into one repo.
