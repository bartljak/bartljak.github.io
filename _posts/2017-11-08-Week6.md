title: Week 6

Since last week I have finished defining all of the XML blocks and have now implemented all of their corresponding VM functions. Initially there were a lot of bugs, but at least 90% of them were caused by the fact that I had used spaces instead of tabs. I have since fixed this, and my code is now running bug free when I run it with the current CScratch code.
