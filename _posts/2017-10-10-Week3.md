After my pull request for the Scratch LLK repo passed all of the checks, there were some other changes that I needed to make to satisfy some documentation requirements. Once I had made all of the appropriate changes, my pull request was accepted and my changes were merged into the develop branch! This was the final step for my first task so I have now moved on to a new task.

I have now begun working on the 3D package for our CScratch repo. I have been examining the work by previous student Hanna Neuman and have started to convert her work into Javascript files that can be loaded in after the default Scratch has been built. They are currently built into the standard Scratch 3.0 package and this makes it difficult to keep our code up to date with the Scratch 3.0 development.
