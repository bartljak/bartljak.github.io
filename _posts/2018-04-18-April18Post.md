One thing I did this week was find a new bug in the scratch-gui. While trying to solve another issue, I was playing around with the sprite size and noticed that if you made a sprite too big to fit in the stage, and then dragged it out of the stage, the sprite would be cropped. I opened up an issue on the repo, but it was closed very quickly. It is now reopened and I believe it was closed due to Codetree messing some stuff up.

Another thing I did this week was work on a few issues for the gui/vm repos. The first issue I worked on was issue #1792 causing sprites to not be displayed on top of the menubar at the top when it is dragged out of the stage. I have not yet fixed this issue, but I think I am close. Another issue I was working on was issue #1702. This issue was asking for a 'random direction' feature to be added for the 'point towards' block. I have implemented a fix for this issue, and am now testing my changes.
